        <h2>Ajithkumar page</h2>
        <p>This book summary was very very short, only 4 blinks total, and while it was very inspirational, I felt the lessons lacked a bit of the actionable tips that the book supposedly holds.</p><br>
        <p>The War Of Art is a fantastic book, and the summary on Blinkist for it is great, so I have no doubt that Do The Work is a good book as well – it just doesn’t really shine through in the summary</p>
